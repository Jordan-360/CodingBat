WarmUp 1 : parrotTrouble


We have a loud talking parrot. The "hour" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0..23. 
We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Return true if we are in trouble.

public boolean parrotTrouble(boolean talking, int hour) {
          //checking if talking is true and hour is less than 7 OR hour is greater than 20
          return (talking) && (hour < 7 || hour > 20);

}
