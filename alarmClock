Logic-1 : alarmClock


Given a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a boolean indicating if we are on vacation, 
return a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. Weekdays, the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". 
Unless we are on vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".


alarmClock(1, false) â†’ "7:00"
alarmClock(5, false) â†’ "7:00"
alarmClock(0, false) â†’ "10:00"

public String alarmClock(int day, boolean vacation) {
   String weekday = "7:00";
        String weekend = "10:00";
        String vacationWeekday = "10:00";
        String vacationWeekend = "off";
        if(vacation && (day == 0 || day == 6)) {
            return vacationWeekend;
        } else if(day >= 1 && day <= 5 && !vacation) {
            return weekday;
        } else if(day == 0 || day == 6) {
            return weekend;
        } 
       return vacationWeekday;
  
}
