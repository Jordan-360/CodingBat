WarmUp-1 : intMax

Given three int values, a b c, return the largest.

public int intMax(int a, int b, int c) {
//setting a new int max variable to 0 
   int max = 0;
   
   //checking if a is greater than b AND a is greater than c
        if (a > b && a > c) {
        //if so, we set max to a
            max = a;
            
  //checking if b is greater than a AND b is greater than c
        } else if (b > a && b > c) {
        //if so, we set max to b
            max = b;
            
 //otherwise, we set the max to c
        } else {
            max = c;
        }

        //returning the created max variable
        return max;
}
