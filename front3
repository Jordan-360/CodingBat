WarmUp-1 : front3

Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. 
If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front.

public String front3(String str) {
//creating new string variable
  String str2 = str;
//checking if the length of the string is greater than 3
        if (str2.length() > 3) {
        if so, we set str2 to the substring of str from index 0 to 3
            str2 = str.substring(0, 3);
        }
      //after that, we then return str2 3 times concatenated together 
        return str2 + str2 + str2;
    }
