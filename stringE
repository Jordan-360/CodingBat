public boolean stringE(String str) {
//initialize an int counter variable to 0
   int counter = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        //looping through the string, we check if the character at index i is equal to 'e'
            if (str.charAt(i) == 'e') {
            //if so, we increment the counter variable by 1
                counter++;
            }
        }
        //Checking and returning if the counter varibale to greater than or equal to 1 AND is less than or equal to 3 (is within the range of 1 to 3 (inclusive))
        return counter >= 1 && counter <= 3;
