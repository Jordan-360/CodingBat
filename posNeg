WarmUp-1 : posNeg

Given 2 int values, return true if one is negative and one is positive. 
Except if the parameter "negative" is true, then return true only if both are negative.

public boolean posNeg(int a, int b, boolean negative) {
//checking if negative is true
  if(negative) { 
  //if so, we return if a && b are both greater than 0
    return (a < 0 && b < 0); 
  } else { 
  if not, we return if a is less than or equal to 0 & b is greater than or equal to 0
  OR 
  if b is less than or equal to 0 & a is greater than or equal to 0
    return ((a <= 0 && b >= 0) || (b <= 0 && a >= 0));
  }
}
