WarmUp-1 : hasTeen

We'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13..19 inclusive. Given 3 int values, return true if 1 or more of them are teen.

public boolean hasTeen(int a, int b, int c) {
  //checking and return if a, b, or c is greater than or equal to 13 and is also less than or equal to 19
    return (a >= 13 && a <= 19 || b >= 13 && b <= 19 || c >= 13 && c <= 19);
}
